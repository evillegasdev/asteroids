# Building My Asteroids Game

Using the boot.dev guided project, "Build Asteroids", I set out to create a simple video game inspired by the classic hit.
While my version doesn’t replicate every detail of the original, it captures the spirit and excitement of navigating a spaceship 
through space debris.

This project offered a great opportunity to work with a multi-file Python setup, and practice applying object-oriented programming 
in a practical and engaging way. It was incredibly rewarding to see the game come together piece by piece, especially knowing that the core logic 
and structure were crafted with intention and clarity.

Rather than diving deep into game development theory or physics simulations, I focused on the parts that mattered most. Such as managing a python
virtual environment, defining custom classes and methods, print debugging troublesome code, and working with git and GitHub.
Some small parts of the code, such as rotation and offsets were pre-written to keep things moving smoothly, allowing me to concentrate on the 
essential mechanics and design choices.

Getting started involved setting up the Boot.dev CLI and running a few tests to ensure everything was configured correctly. 
From there, the real fun began; watching the game evolve from concept to playable experience.

This project was not just about building a game; it was about exploring how Python OOP can be used creatively 
and effectively in real-world scenarios.


## Tech and concepts used

- **Windows 11 Hyper-V** — Microsoft's enterprise-grade hypervisor technology built into Windows Server and Windows. Used to run a Linux VM.
- **Linux Ubuntu 22.04.1** — A stable and widely-used open-source operating system, ideal for development environments.
- **Python 3.10+** — Core programming language used for game logic and structure.
- **Pygame package** — Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing games. It is written on top of the excellent SDL library.
- **uv (Python Package Manager)** — Used for managing Python dependencies and virtual environments
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — Used to model game entities like the spaceship and asteroids.
- **Multi-file Project Structure** — Organized codebase for scalability and clarity.
